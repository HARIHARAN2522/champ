# Dashboard

The **CloudMaSa Dashboard** is your single pane of glass for monitoring, managing, and automating AWS, GCP, and Azure resources — all from one place. No more switching between consoles or CLI tools. Everything you need — at a glance.

##  Welcome & Account Status

At the top of your dashboard, you’ll see:

- **Welcome, [Your Name] [role]**  
  → Personalized greeting + role badge (e.g., super-admin, admin, editor)
- **AWS Cloud • Connected**  
  → Shows which cloud provider is active (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Last synced: 4:41:29 PM**  
  → Real-time indicator of when data was last pulled

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Click **“Refresh”** to force an immediate sync if you’ve made recent changes in your cloud console.

##  Quick Actions — One-Click Operations
