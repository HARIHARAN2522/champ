## How It Works

The workflow is divided into 5 simple steps:

1. **Connection** — Connect to your cloud account
2. **Existing Resources** — View resources already deployed via IaC (Terraform)
3. **Modules** — Select which cloud resources to deploy
4. **Configure** — Customize module settings
5. **Create** — Deploy your infrastructure
